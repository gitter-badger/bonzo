Release Notes for Bonzo 0.1.2
=============================

*February 04, 2014*

- ``bonzo.smtpserver`` module is renamed to :mod:`bonzo.server`. This is
  motivated to add a module called ``smtp`` containing tools for handling
  requests with asynchronous features, very similar to :mod:`tornado.web`.
- Added Python 3 support.
- Added Travis and Coveralls configuration (Issue :issue:`#1 <1>`). Thanks to
  Luis Mayta.
